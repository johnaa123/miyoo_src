- HHeretic saved game files are not interoperable between 32 and 64 bit
  and/or big endian and little endian machines: saves are byte order and
  word size dependant.

- As it is, HHeretic can not read game saves from DOS Heretic, because
  Raven seems to have liked the "zp1" switch of Watcom which alinged
  structures on bytes.  In order to be able to load the save files from
  DOS-Heretic, the mobj_t and player_t structures in doomdef.h and the
  floormove_t structure in p_spec.h must be added the "packed" attribute
  of gcc:  you can use the patch written below in order to do it.  When
  that is done though, HHeretic won't be able to read its own saves from
  versions not modified this way.
